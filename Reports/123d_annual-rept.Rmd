### Abstract

Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR, Moab, UT) expended `r sum(as.numeric(s_summary$effort_hr))` hours of electrofishing effort under Project 123d to remove nonnative walleye from the upper Colorado River Basin in `r unique(year(site$tm_end))`. Crews focused removal efforts within specific subreaches where walleye catch rates are highest: downstream of Tusher Diversion (River Mile (RM) `r s_summary_rch$LGR$start_rmi_max` - `r s_summary_rch$LGR$end_rmi_min`) and Lower Gray Canyon (RM `r s_summary_rch$DESO$start_rmi_max` - `r s_summary_rch$DESO$end_rmi_min`) on the Green River and Lower Westwater Canyon (RM `r s_summary_rch$LWW$start_rmi_max` - `r s_summary_rch$LWW$end_rmi_min`) on the Colorado River. A total of `r sum(cpue$fish_ct[cpue$cd_spp == "WE"])` walleye and `r sum(cpue$fish_ct[cpue$cd_spp == "SM"])` smallmouth bass were encountered throughout sampling in `r yr`. While walleye encounters were similar to recent years, smallmouth bass captures on the Lower Colorado River were substantially more frequent. <br><br>

The Tusher Diversion dam creates a semi-passable barrier on the Green River and delineates the upper boundary of the Tusher Walleye Management Reach.

### Tusher Reach

The Green River peaked at `r w_summary_rvr$GR$discharge_max` cfs on `r w_summary_rvr$GR$dt_max_flow`, measured on USGS gage 09315000, located at the town of Green River, Utah (Figure 2). Crews began sampling below Tusher Diversion on `r s_summary_rch$LGR$date_min` and ended on `r s_summary_rch$LGR$date_max`. Main channel temperatures ranged between `r s_summary_rch$LGR$temp_rng` °C during sampling (Table 1). Crews sampled between river miles `r s_summary_rch$LGR$start_rmi_max` and `r s_summary_rch$LGR$end_rmi_min` (Figure 1).

A total of `r s_summary_rch$LGR$effort_hr` hours of effort were allocated to this reach and  `r cpue_rch$LGR$fish_ct[cpue_rch$LGR$cn_spp == "walleye"]` walleye were removed (catch-per-unit-effort [cpue] = `r cpue_rch$LGR$cpue[cpue_rch$LGR$cn_spp == "walleye"]` fish-per-hour).  Walleye catch rates are similar to recent years (Table 4), but with increased effort substantially more walleye have been removed in 2019 and 2020 than previous years. Walleye total lengths within this reach were also similar to recent years (mean = `r round(mean(fish_bio$LGR$tot_length[fish_bio$LGR$cd_spp == "WE"], na.rm = TRUE))` mm, range = `r min(fish_bio$LGR$tot_length[fish_bio$LGR$cd_spp == "WE"], na.rm = TRUE)` - `r max(fish_bio$LGR$tot_length[fish_bio$LGR$cd_spp == "WE"], na.rm = TRUE)` mm) (Figure 3). Additionally, researchers removed `r cpue_rch$LGR$fish_ct[cpue_rch$LGR$cn_spp == "smallmouth bass"]` smallmouth bass (cpue = `r cpue_rch$LGR$cpue[cpue_rch$LGR$cn_spp == "smallmouth bass"]` fish-per-hour) and `r cpue_rch$LGR$fish_ct[cpue_rch$LGR$cn_spp == "northern pike"]` northern pike (cpue = `r cpue_rch$LGR$cpue[cpue_rch$LGR$cn_spp == "northern pike"]` fish-per-hour) (Table 2). Native fish encounters are summarized in Table 3.

### Lower Gray Canyon Reach

Utah Division of Wildlife Resources completed an experimental two day removal pass in Lower Gray Canyon between 24 and 25 June 2020.  Noting a subtle increase in smallmouth bass within the Tusher reach and curious as to presence of walleye above the Tusher diversion we committed to a two-day raft-based removal pass. Crews encountered no walleye and only one smallmouth bass (Table 5) and few endangered fish (Table 6) within this reach. Researchers sampled between river miles `r s_summary_rch$DESO$start_rmi_max` and `r s_summary_rch$DESO$end_rmi_min` (Figure 1).

### Lower Westwater Reach

The Colorado River, at USGS gage 09180500, located near Cisco, UT, peaked at `r w_summary_rvr$CO$discharge_max` cfs on `r w_summary_rvr$CO$dt_max_flow` (Figure 4).  Crews began sampling within Lower Westwater Canyon on `r s_summary_rch$LWW$date_min` and ended on `r s_summary_rch$LWW$date_max`. Main channel temperatures ranged between `r s_summary_rch$LWW$temp_rng`°C during sampling (Table 1). Crews sampled between river miles `r s_summary_rch$LWW$start_rmi_max` and`r s_summary_rch$LWW$end_rmi_min` (Figure 1).  During past years UDWR has encountered substantial numbers of walleye and smallmouth bass within this reach. Consequently, we monitor this reach under Project 123d and if walleye or smallmouth catch rates warrant, we apply additional removal effort.

```{r}
h_co <- hydro(water, .river_code = "CO", .fig_num = 4)

# Modify caption to include data and richer text
extra_text <- "This figure is depicts the dates on which sampling occurred (points) and the river discharge (line) during the sampling period."
# cap_dat <- filter(water, cd_rvr == "CO" & !is.na(cd_rch)) %>% 
#   distinct(date, .keep_all = TRUE)
# dt_sample <- format(cap_dat$date[cap_dat$cd_rvr == "CO" & !is.na(cap_dat$cd_rch)], "%B %d")
# dis_sample <- paste(cap_dat$discharge[cap_dat$cd_rvr == "CO" & !is.na(cap_dat$cd_rch)], "cfs")

A total of `r s_summary_rch$LWW$effort_hr` hours of effort was allocated to this reach and crews removed a total of `r cpue_rch$LWW$fish_ct[cpue_rch$LWW$cn_spp == "walleye"]` walleye (catch-per-unit-effort [cpue] = `r cpue_rch$LWW$cpue[cpue_rch$LWW$cn_spp == "walleye"]` fish-per-hour).  Additionally, `r cpue_rch$LWW$fish_ct[cpue_rch$LWW$cn_spp == "smallmouth bass"]` smallmouth bass were removed (cpue = `r cpue_rch$LWW$cpue[cpue_rch$LWW$cn_spp == "smallmouth bass"]`) within this reach (Table 7, Figure 5). This catch-rate is substantially higher than recent years (Table 9). This is particularly concerning due to the close proximity of the Westwater Canyon humpback chub population. Smallmouth bass mean total length in 2020 was `r round(mean(fish_bio$LWW$tot_length[fish_bio$LWW$cd_spp == "SM"], na.rm = TRUE))` mm (range = `r min(fish_bio$LWW$tot_length[fish_bio$LWW$cd_spp == "SM"], na.rm = TRUE)` - `r max(fish_bio$LWW$tot_length[fish_bio$LWW$cd_spp == "SM"], na.rm = TRUE)` mm) (Figure 6). Ancillary captures of native species are noted in Table 8.

IV.	Abstract: <br><br>
Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR, Moab, UT) expended `r sum(as.numeric(s_summary$effort_hr))` hours of electrofishing effort under Project 123d to remove nonnative walleye from the upper Colorado River Basin in `r unique(year(site$tm_end))`. Crews focused removal efforts within specific subreaches where walleye catch rates are highest: downstream of Tusher Diversion (River Mile (RM) `r s_summary_rch$LGR$start_rmi_max` - `r s_summary_rch$LGR$end_rmi_min`) and Lower Gray Canyon (RM `r s_summary_rch$DESO$start_rmi_max` - `r s_summary_rch$DESO$end_rmi_min`) on the Green River and Lower Westwater Canyon (RM `r s_summary_rch$LWW$start_rmi_max` - `r s_summary_rch$LWW$end_rmi_min`) on the Colorado River. A total of `r sum(cpue$fish_ct[cpue$cd_spp == "WE"])` walleye and `r sum(cpue$fish_ct[cpue$cd_spp == "SM"])` smallmouth bass were encountered throughout sampling in `r yr`. While walleye encounters were similar to recent years, smallmouth bass captures on the Lower Colorado River were substantially more frequent. <br><br>

IX.	Recommendations: <br><br>  

    * **Tusher Reach (Green River)**  
  Continued application of effort between Tusher Diversion and Green River
  State Park (RM 128-120) as this segment has the highest catch rates for walleye in
  the reach. Removal should be conducted spring through early summer, or when justified by 
  noteworthy catch rates. <br><br> 

    * **Lower Grey Canyon (Green River)**  
  Targeted walleye removal within this reach is not warranted at present time. Monitor through project 
  123a (Deso bass removal) efforts when appropriate. <br><br>
  
    * **Lower Westwater Canyon (Colorado River)**  
  Continued application of effort between Big Hole camp and Fish Ford (RM 116-105.5). Removal should be 
  conducted spring through early summer, or when justified by noteworthy catch rates of walleye *or* 
  smallmouth bass. <br><br>
